# User Management Application

## Description

This project is a user management application built using React, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript. It fetches user data from a mock API and displays it in a dynamic table. The table features advanced filtering options, allowing users to search by name, username, email, and phone. As the user types in the search fields, the displayed results update in real-time. The application leverages Redux for efficient state management and ensures type safety throughout the codebase using TypeScript.

## What I've Learned

Working on this project helped me deepen my understanding of:

- **Redux Toolkit**: I learned how to efficiently manage global state with slices and reducers, especially in scenarios involving real-time filtering.
- **TypeScript**: I improved my knowledge of enforcing strong typing in React components and Redux state, reducing runtime errors and improving code quality.
- **Advanced Filtering Techniques**: I explored advanced filtering mechanisms that dynamically update displayed data based on multiple input fields, providing a smooth user experience.
- **Project Structuring**: Organizing a project that handles both data fetching and complex state management in a clean and scalable way.
- **UI Design**: Balancing functionality and design to create a clean, user-friendly interface for managing users.
